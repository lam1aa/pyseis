## Component Analysis
### 1. Data Acquisition
- **Purpose**: To collect seismology data from various sources.
- **Inputs**: Source type (e.g., file path, database connection).
- **Outputs**: Raw data in a structured format.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Purpose**: To clean and transform raw data to a usable state.
- **Inputs**: Raw data.
- **Processes**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Normalizing data.
  - Filtering noise.
- **Outputs**: Preprocessed data ready for analysis.
### 3. Data Analysis
- **Purpose**: To apply analytical methods to extract insights from data.
- **Inputs**: Preprocessed data.
- **Processes**:
  - Frequency analysis.
  - Event detection.
  - Statistical analysis.
- **Outputs**: Analytical results.
### 4. Data Visualization
- **Purpose**: To create visual representations of the analytical results.
- **Inputs**: Analytical results.
- **Processes**:
  - Generating plots (e.g., time series, spectrograms).
  - Creating interactive visualizations.
- **Outputs**: Visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs).
### 5. Reporting
- **Purpose**: To compile results and visualizations into a comprehensive report.
- **Inputs**: Analytical results, visualizations.
- **Processes**:
  - Formatting text.
  - Embedding visualizations.
- **Outputs**: Report document (e.g., PDF, HTML).
